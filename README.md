SlitherLogic
------------

Slitherlink that you can program! SlitherLogic is (or will be) a game that has automated rules to let you focus on the harder parts of Slitherlink.

[Play SlitherLogic!](http://darthwalsh.github.io/SlitherLogic/)

Instead of being an app for just one program, SlitherLogic is written in HTML5. You should be able to play on your computer, phone, tablet, and maybe even game console! We write in Typescript and use the KineticJS library for graphics, and it all gets compiled to EMCAscript (coughjavascriptcough) for release on the web.
